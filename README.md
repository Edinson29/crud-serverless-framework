# Serverless Framework Python HTTP API on AWS

This template demonstrates how to make a simple HTTP API with Python running on AWS Lambda and API Gateway using the Serverless Framework.

This template does not include any kind of persistence (database). For more advanced examples, check out the [serverless/examples repository](https://github.com/serverless/examples/) which includes DynamoDB, Mongo, Fauna and other examples.

## Usage

### Deployment

> **Important:** The Lambda Layer (`layer/python/`) is git-ignored and must be populated with Python packages before deploying. Use the `make deploy` command below — it handles both steps automatically.

```bash
make deploy
```

Or run the steps manually:

```bash
make install-layer   # build layer/python/ from requirements-layer.txt
serverless deploy
```

After deploying, you should see output similar to:

```
Deploying "aws-python-http-api" to stage "dev" (us-east-1)

✔ Service deployed to stack aws-python-http-api-dev (85s)

endpoint: GET - https://6ewcye3q4d.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
functions:
  hello: aws-python-http-api-dev-hello (2.3 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

Which should result in response similar to the following (removed `input` content for brevity):

```json
{
  "message": "Go Serverless v4.0! Your function executed successfully!"
}
```

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```
serverless invoke local --function hello
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\n  \"message\": \"Go Serverless v4.0! Your function executed successfully!\"}"
}
```

Alternatively, it is also possible to emulate API Gateway and Lambda locally by using `serverless-offline` plugin. In order to do that, execute the following command:

```
serverless plugin install -n serverless-offline
```

It will add the `serverless-offline` plugin to `devDependencies` in `package.json` file as well as will add it to `plugins` in `serverless.yml`.

After installation, you can start local emulation with:

```
serverless offline
```

To learn more about the capabilities of `serverless-offline`, please refer to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline).

### Bundling dependencies

Python dependencies are shipped as a **Lambda Layer** (`layer/python/`), which is shared across all four functions. The `layer/python/` directory is git-ignored and must be populated locally before deploying.

Install the dependencies targeting the `manylinux` platform used by AWS Lambda:

```bash
pip install \
  --target layer/python \
  --platform manylinux2014_x86_64 \
  --implementation cp \
  --python-version 3.12 \
  --only-binary=:all: \
  --upgrade \
  -r requirements-layer.txt
```

> `boto3` and `botocore` are listed in `requirements.txt` for local development but are kept out of `requirements-layer.txt` because AWS Lambda already includes them in the Python 3.12 runtime.

After running the command above, deploy normally:

```bash
serverless deploy
```
